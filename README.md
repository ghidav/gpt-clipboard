# üîÆ GPT Clipboard
Automate your tasks with GPT Shortcuts, a powerful tool to interact with GPT directly from your clipboard!

**Requirements**
* Python installed on your pc
* An OpenAI API key

## Setup

Clone the repository and install the python requirements.

```
git clone https://github.com/ghidav/gpt-clipboard.git
cd gpt-clipboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to know the path to your pyhton compiler, to find it you can use `which python` or `which python3`.

Open the python script (`coding.py`) and paste your OpenAI API key in `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."`. The example contains the prompt for code completion, here's the prompt passed to the model before the selected text: 

```
"You are a coding assistant.
You read code and a comment; you take the comment as an instruction to complete the code.\nYou write only the code completion.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**You can freely customize the prompt to meet your personal needs!**
